# 📢 Internship Notifier

A learning project to build an automated system that finds internship opportunities online and notifies me when new ones appear.

This project is being developed step by step while learning Python automation, web data extraction, and basic system design.

## 🎯 Motivation

Internship opportunities often appear and disappear quickly.  
Manually checking multiple websites every day is inefficient.

The goal of this project is to:
- Automatically track internship postings
- Reduce manual searching
- Learn how real-world automation systems are built
